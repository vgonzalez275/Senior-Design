# Senior-Design
My team and I have designed an Electric Assist Bike to help reduce obesity by exercise.
The motor controller program takes the heart rate of the rider and uses the heart rate to control the speed of the bike. 
If the heart rate is normal the motor will not assist the rider but if the heart rate has reached 80% of the max heart rate then the motor will assist.
