My team and I have designed an Electric Assist Bike to help reduce obesity by exercise.
The motor controller program takes the heart rate of the rider and uses the heart rate to control the speed of the bike. 
If the heart rate is normal the motor will not assist the rider but if the heart rate has reached 80% of the max heart rate then the motor will assist.

-The logger program logs the riders heart rate, speed, and ambient temperature of the surroundings by collecting sensor data.
The logger logs data to a file up to a max size of 20 MB. If the file reaches the max size it will create a new file to log data.
-The start up script runs all programs by one command remotely from the Raspberry Pi 3.
